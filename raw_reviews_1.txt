Tasting Note
Firm and focused, with a solid core of blackberry, currant and spice aromas and flavors shaded by cedar and bark notes on the finish. Very youthful and full of extract. Should be at its best after 1995, when it sheds some tannin. —

Tasting Note
This extraordinary bottle still reflects the Ducru style: silky, balanced and long. Deep prune, cedar and earth aromas give way to clean cherry and prune flavors. Sweet and very long on the finish. Recorked at the château in 1980, this bottle was contributed by collector Stephen Kaplan.--Ducru-Beaucaillou vertical. — TM

The first wine from this suburban Los Angeles winery is deep, ripe and almost Port-like, with generous black cherry, plum and anise aromas and flavors, full body and spicy, earthy notes on the finish. Has tannin to burn, suggesting it might be best after 1998. 226 cases made. —

Tasting Note
Tight, firm and crisp; an austere wine that's true to the vintage. The flavors are ripe and round, with currant, spice and berry notes, but leave you searching for more richness and depth. The tannins on the finish are crisp and lean; could show a little more tenderness and suppleness. Perhaps with time that will come. Still, it's very good. —

Despite an earthy, gamy edge, this one delivers a solid glass of Zinfandel with spice and berry flavors that are a bit rough, but at this price, it's an excellent everyday Zin. Drink now. 8,500 cases made. — JL

Bold, ripe, rich and concentrated, offering an elegant core of currant, spice, herb and meat flavors. The color is dark, the texture is smooth and supple, and the oak adds nice flavors and dimension to the wine. Tempting now, but it should age through through 2000.
