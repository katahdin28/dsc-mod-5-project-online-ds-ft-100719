Tasting Note
A magnificent wine, built like a '48 Fonseca or Taylor Port; perhaps the greatest Figeac ever made. Still deep ruby in color, showing ripe fruit and black licorice aromas and a hint of violets. Full-bodied, with masses of bitter chocolate and ripe fruit flavors and a very long finish. Superb. Drink now.--Figeac vertical. — JS

Still rather tough, but has an amazing amount of fruit; lives up to the glorious reputation of the vintage.

An exotic style that tastes sweet. Packs in lots of flavor, including rich pear, honey, orange blossom and spice and a texture that turns thick and oily on the finish. Almost reminds us of Gewürztraminer. 288 cases made. —
