Tasting Note
Elegant and refined, with ripe, smooth and silky flavors that echo cherry, raspberry and spice and finish with toasty, buttery oak. Not quite as concentrated as the wonderful '91, but worthy nonetheless. Perhaps with more bottle time it will show more complexities. Drink now. 1,000 cases made. —

Bristling with youthful freshness, this tightly wound auslese has a vibrant backbone of acidity kicking life into the apricot, vanilla and mineral flavors. Has a very long finish. The acidity will need time to settle down. Best after 1997. —
