Tasting Note
Absolutely glorious. A magnificent Sauvignon Blanc that combines the grape's peach, melon and citrus flavors with beautifully integrated new-oak components of vanilla and nutmeg. Harmonious, creamy and firmly structured, this tastes delicious now, yet should develop over the next few years. Drink now through 2005. — BS

Tasting Note
This late-release 1997 has already evolved beyond the rich, primary fruit flavors typically found in a young wine (which is somewhat disappointing given the excellence of the vintage), offering more mature flavors of dusty berry, dill and cedary oak, with a touch of anise.

Great intensity of Hermitage terroir in this explosive, full-bodied, traditional red. Like a slow-burning fuse, it takes some time to detonate all its multifaceted power. Loaded with plum, blackberry, citrus and mineral, also with an earthy note, it bursts with fruit flavors on the ultralong finish. First classic-rated wine for Graillot. Last vintage for his Hermitage though, as he lost his leased vineyards. Best from 2005 through 2015. 50 cases made. — PM

A bit disappointing for Cornas. Has some cassis bush character, but lacks the depth and ripeness expected in this appellation. Shows crushed red berry notes on the crisp, slightly dilute and herbaceous finish. 2,440 cases made. — PM

Opulent Hermitage that blends local terroir with an international style. Full-bodied, rich and ripe, it cascades with blackberries, raspberries and grilled and toasted notes.

Easy wine, tasting more of licorice than anything else, that's open and ready to drink. Doesn't provoke much afterthought. The sort of wine to drink slightly chilled by the glass with lunch. Drink now. 80,000 cases made. — PM

This wine deftly embellishes pear flavors with earthy and coconut notes from oak aging to offer complexity, balance and the potential to improve in the bottle for a year or two. —

A beauty, combining the best of two worlds: On the one hand, it's thick, full-bodied and round; on the other, it's elegant and racy, with a good balance between mineral, fruit and oak, and the character of a fine cigar on the very long finish. Drink now through 2006. 300 cases made. — PM

Tasting Note
Not your normal Chardonnay. The honey, spice and candied apple flavors suggest a late-harvest wine, though there's not much sweetness. It's concentrated and distinctive; better alone than with food. Drink now. 3,500 cases made. —

Nice white, if a bit less intense than some other 2000 white Châteauneufs.

Too herbaceous for me. Like a puree of green beans. Still, there's some fruit and thick tannins. Some people may like slightly green Merlot, but it's rather disappointing. What happened? Best after 2002. 580 cases made. — JS

Aromatically very pretty, bursting with raspberries. Light- to medium-bodied, this is smoky, fruity and succulent, but lacks silky smoothness. An herbal note creeps in on the tough finish. Drink now through 2004. — PM

A St.-Joseph with hidden strength. Reserved at first, it turns up the volume on the palate, revealing a layer of attractive mineral, wet earth and terroir character that follows through on the long finish along with a spicy, menthol note. Tough now, it should improve with cellaring. Best from 2003 through 2008. 440 cases made. — PM

Quite backward now, this dense Cab is keeping its currant, cocoa, mineral, loam and toast notes in reserve while the thick tannins work themselves out. Impressive concentration, with a long, grip-filled finish. Built for the cellar. Most impressive Don Melchor yet. Best from 2004 through 2010. 11,935 cases made. — JM

Earthy, gamy flavors pervade this otherwise solid, muscular red, which bursts with rich cherry, blackberry, mint and spice flavors that ultimately prevail on the long, powerful finish. It echoes with a note of chocolate, but it's always going to be gamy. Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Drink now through 2010. 35 cases imported. — HS

Explosively aromatic and extraordinarily long, this well-balanced wine doesn't show its muscle as much as does its structure to propel the gorgeous flavors. Cherries, berries, earth and mineral notes mingle enticingly, wrapped in a gentle buzz of tannins. A stylish wine that should age well. Drink now through 2012. 35 cases imported. — HS
