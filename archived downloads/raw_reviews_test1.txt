(Recorked at the château in 1991.) A stupendous wine that defines elegance and richness. The classic crème brûlée aroma is especially enticing, but the honey and floral notes are the most glorious on the palate. Hints of pear and nutmeg add life and interest. Just a touch of smoky bitterness on the finish adds a welcome balance.--Yquem vertical. — HS

Tasting Note
A solid wine, with wonderful structure for aging, but still closed and not giving much at this stage. Dark-ruby color, with smoke, berry and cherry aromas and flavors. Loads of velvety tannins, full body and a long finish. Great, soft texture. Wait until at least 1997.--Super Tuscan retrospective. — JS

Here's a winner. Bottle age has given this wine rich, exotic mature flavors of tobacco, cedar, plums and prunes; it's big but silky, firm but well-integrated, with a core of tannins that support but never intrude. Though it lacks the grapey freshness characteristic of young Beaujolais, it has only grown over time. Drink now. —

This is about as big as a Loire red gets. It has a deep, young color, open aromas of smoke, meat and plums, and it's firm on the palate, with plenty of plum and tobacco flavors. It's distinctive and rich. Drink now. —

In four separate tastings, this showed mature, well-developed Cabernet flavors in its lesser moments and extraordinary richness, depth and complexity at its best.

This wine showed the best of the three Diamond Creek bottlings. Rich and earthy, but deeply colored and very concentrated, it has uncommon depth and intensity for a Cabernet this age. While exhibiting exceptionally well now, it appears to have the kind of richness and intensity to improve for another decade. Still, it's best to drink soon rather than risk its drying out.--1974 California Cabernet horizontal. 105 cases made. — JL

Earthy but elegant, of medium body; chewy and mouth-puckering, and packing plenty of grapefruit, pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. Fresh and delicious now, it should improve with aging until at least 1997. —

Tasting Note
A class act worth lining up around the block to taste. Massive, muscular and quite woody. Good acidity, formidable fruit concentration and a layer of toasty character make it a serious candidate for the wine of the vintage. Needs time; try in 1998 and beyond. Tasted twice, with consistent notes. 200 cases made. —

Cedar and mint flavors dominate this wine now, overshadowing the tight, lean plum flavor and finishing with a biting woody finish that's a little blunt and harsh. May get better with time but at $16 it seems like a gamble. — JL

Tasting Note
Flavorful, concentrated and artfully balanced. Marvelously ripe cherry, cassis and plum flavors play elegantly against a smoky, herbal edge in the nose and on the palate. It's drinkable now but there's plenty of tannin to suggest cellaring for three to five years. —

Smells better than it tastes. Tart and lively, with a modest concentration of berry flavor and a shade more tannin than the wine seems willing to support. Perhaps cellaring until 1995 will resolve the tannins, but it seems a bit out of balance. —

Tasting Note
Ripe and rich, but very well balanced, with delicious cassis and plum fruit framed by spicy oak and smoke, medium bodied, supple and graceful. Not built for aging, but it can hold for a couple of years. Not as good as the '83. —

Tasting Note
An assertively smoky, tannic Merlot with the richness of chocolate and ripe berries. The tannins gang up on the finish, like many California reds from this vintage. Still, it's a nice mouthful. St. Clement's first Merlot. —

Tough and tannic at first, and then the pretty violet, vanilla and currant aromas and flavors emerge, complicated by cedar and herb overtones. It has the depth of character, richness and finesse to warrant cellaring until at least 1995. —

Tasting Note
Powerful and ripe yet smooth and elegantly balanced, with complex cherry, plum, clove and smoke aromas and flavors, a bracing backbone of wood and plenty of flesh to fill it out. There's some real depth on this one, especially at the price. —

Effusively fruity, yet dry and crisp enough to get the blackberry, raspberry fruit sailing nicely across the palate. A tinge of earthiness gives it a balsamic-vinegar edge, which is pleasant and begs for food. —

Tasting Note
For its debut in a cork-finished high-shouldered bottle, Gallo's perennial favorite is lean and fruity, with black and pepper and berry flavors reminiscent of Syrah; a hit of toasty oak keeps it in line, and the tannin is well within bounds on the finish. — HS

A fairly attractive Zinfandel with plenty of fruit and oak to go around. It 's got fresh berry and peppery notes and a good dose of tannin, but it's well balanced and eminently drinkable. —

A superb claret. This is a huge, well-structured wine, packed with tons of vanilla and chocolate notes that play against a background of concentrated berry flavors. So powerful that it stole the show in this flight. Tasted like a barrel sample; try around 2000.--Mouton-Rothschild vertical. Best after 2000. — PM

Lush apricot and slightly floral fruit on the nose picks up some honeyed richness on the palate to add complexity and with a good shot of acidity to balance, it doesn't finish as sweet as it could. With a little more depth, it could be outstanding. —

Tasting Note
Very fruity and pleasant to drink. The tart cherry and berry flavors unfold nicely on the palate in a soft, smooth style that makes it attractive now, but it should hold up well for another two to three years. — JL
