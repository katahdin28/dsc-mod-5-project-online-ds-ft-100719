Tasting Note
Seductive, silky and unctuous, a medium-bodied Châteauneuf that tastes as if made in an oxidative, traditional style: a bit light in color, with brown sugar and licorice and signs of advanced maturity from forest underbrush and truffle notes. But it has lots of gras ("fat"). Lovely balance, with sweet, well-integrated tannins. Drink now through 2010. 4,165 cases made. — PM

Tasting Note
A bit earthy, this medium-bodied Crozes shows plenty of chocolate, red berry, black cherry, spice, black pepper and wet earth notes. Made in a commercial style, but should go nicely with grilled red meat. Best from 2001 through 2005. 1,250 cases made. — PM

Don't expect a silky palate massage, just a tough, sweaty workout that will leave your senses satisfied. Tough and sinewy, muscular and impressive in its firm tannin structure, there's plenty going on. Think campfire and grilled meat with this hardy, rustic, gamy, leathery red.

Tasting Note
A warm-weather, hot-vintage sort of wine. Very plummy and even showing prunelike aromas, along with nice blackberry flavors, this is ultradense, massively tannic but ripe and balanced, stressing fruit above all. From Michel Bernard. Best from 2000 through 2005. 915 cases made. — PM

Much more expressive on the nose than the '97--and darker and thicker--adding to the evidence that '96 is a better vintage in the northern Rhône. Delivers a round, clean, pure mouthfeel of vibrant, focused red berry and blackberry flavors. Superb balance, as it walks a tightrope among the relatively high acidity, ripe tannins and delicious fruit. Worth cellaring.--La Chapelle vertical. Best from 2003 through 2015. —

Wonderful perfumed bouquet, with cherry and molasses character and hints of pecan. Full-bodied and very sweet, with a long, fruity, maple syrup aftertaste. It's starting to resemble a tawny more than a vintage Port, but that's splitting hairs. Gorgeous.--Dow vertical. Drink now. — JS

Only in Burgundy. This is a gorgeous wine exploding with idiosyncratic goût de terroir. Subtle and complex dried herb, butter, wet stone and ripe fruit notes kick up a tornado that persists on the deftly oaked finish. Drink now through 2010. 50 cases imported. — PM

Tastes exquisitely ripe and much better than it smells (very oaky), but give this medium-bodied white some time and it should come fully together. For now, it has toasted oak, pear, pineapple and lemon-jam notes. Supple texture. Best from 2002 through 2007. 315 cases made. — PM
