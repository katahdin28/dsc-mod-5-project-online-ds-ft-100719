Elegant and refined. A medium-bodied Chablis with lots of subtlety, this is anchored in the soil, with mineral, spice, and just-so oak and ripe fruit. Balanced finish. A wine that should only get better with short-term aging. Best from 2002 through 2008. 280 cases made. — PM

Goes for the gusto, and pulls it off. Dense texture, with gobs of cassis, kirsch and blackberry—like the distilled essence of Cabernet fruit.

Tasting Note
Gorgeous. Blockbuster-style of Côtes du Rhône, inky-black and full-bodied. Deftly pumped up with fancy oak, packing in tar, smoke and concentrated, black, sweet fruit. Tannins are amazingly supple for such a monster red. Excellent winemaking. Drink now through 2010. 1,000 cases made. — PM

Tasting Note
A beautiful international-styled Rhône red, nicely balanced between oak and fruit. Dark-colored, aromatically expressive, this medium-bodied seducer is loaded with fresh, clean and pure red and black fruit supported by distinctive oak nuances (mocha, spice, smoke, grilled bacon). Seamless finish, thanks to well-integrated tannins. Drink now through 2010. 380 cases made. — PM

Different, but impressive. Earthy, with matchstick and flinty notes, this is a minerally, full-bodied Chablis that pumps out honey, pear and green apple tart character. Long, intense finish. This was the better of two bottles. Drink now through 2006. — PM
