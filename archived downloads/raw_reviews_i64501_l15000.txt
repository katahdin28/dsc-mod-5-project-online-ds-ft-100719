Lush and round, packed with fruit and serious tannins. A medium- to full-bodied red, with bitter chocolate lacing the blackberry and a wet earth complexity. All that fruit should balance the tough tannins, so cellar a bit. Best from 2000 through 2004. — PM

Very, very nice '96, full of personality. Good concentration, from the meaty, smoked bacon, charcoal, notes to the black currant, black cherry and spicy plum. Full-bodied and fresh, with well-integrated tannins. A bit hard on the finish, but still tempting. Drink now through 2001. 150 cases imported. — PM

Tasting Note
This massive wine resembles a young Port in its extraordinary concentration of ripe, sweet fruit, thick texture and potential for long aging. Closed now, it only hints at the richness of ripe fruit that hides behind the iron tannins and lavish oak. Few Spanish reds attain this degree of power and intensity; with time, it should also develop the harmony and elegance the country's best wines are know for.--Pesquera vertical. Best after 2008. — TM

Tasting Note
A gorgeous, subtle Brunello. Not the powerful style that Altesino's single-vineyard Brunello can be in great years such as 1990, but an outstanding, classy bottle. Floral, blackberry and meat aromas follow through to a medium-bodied palate, with very fine tannins and a zingy finish. Best after 2001. 1,650 cases made. —

Wild thing. This Italian red is even better than the wonderful debut '95.

Tasting Note
A beautiful wine with a long finish. At first sip this is sharp and crisp, showing lime and citrus flavors, but it turns a bit earthy on the palate and develops yeasty, chalky notes.--Dom Pérignon vertical. Best after 1996. —

Tasting Note
This Cabernet is worth a second look--and not just for its value price. Fairly rich in texture, it offers a lot of smoky oak flavor, black currant and licorice notes and also harbors a pleasant herbal quality at the core. Finishing moderately, with mild tannins. 45,000 cases made. —

This muscular Latour is deep and dark-colored, its ripe berry oozing from the glass with undertones of vanilla and minerals. Full-bodied, and incredibly chewy, with masses of tannins and a long, long fruity finish. This is how they built clarets in the great years of the 1960s and 1950s. Best after 2005. 17,000 cases made. — JS

A pretty St.-Emilion with aromas and flavors of berries and bark. Medium-bodied, with medium tannins and a rather short finish. Lacks fruit at midpalate. Not quite as good as I remember from barrel. Best after 1999. 3,416 cases made. —

A blockbuster, seriously dark, with intense aromas of smoke, raisin, berry and grilled meat. Full-bodied and incredibly fruity, slightly sweet, with loads of flavor and chewy tannins. An alternative to vintage Port, but would go well with large hunks of grilled meat as well as cheese. Drink now through 2010. 1,000 cases made. — JS

Tasting Note
A drier style of auslese. Pungent with red berries, almonds and smoke, this is ripe and assertive, with a succulent texture and bright acidity. A touch of alcohol on the finish lends a slight coarseness now, but there's plenty of ripe fruit to match. Gunderloch's three stars here indicate a traditional winemaking style in which fermantation is allowed to complete naturally. Drink now through 2005. 80 cases made. — BS

Wonderful depth of flavor. A combination of stone and citrus fruits mingle with a mineral element and a rich texture, providing complexity and length. There's enough acidity and a fillip of bitterness to keep everything in focus. Drink now through 2007. 150 cases imported. — BS

Tasting Note
Gorgeous Pinot Blanc. Aromatic, rich and complex, while maintaining a sense of elegance. Offers white peach, orange and mineral elements on a fat texture, yet stays balanced and bright, ending with a nutty taste. Drink now through 2001. — BS

Buttery aromas are followed by a rich mix fig and ripe pear flavors, with some tropical notes. A bit cloying on the spicyish finish. Drink now. 2,500 cases made. — KM
