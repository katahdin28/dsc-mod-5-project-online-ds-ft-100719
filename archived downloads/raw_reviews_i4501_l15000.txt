Impressive concentration and depth, the kind of intense flavor, firm tannin, grace and harmony that assures a great wine in 10 to12 years. Flavors are so complex and harmonious that it s hard to pick out the individual elements, but you can find plum, vanilla, lilac and nutmeg. —

Has richness on the nose, but it's also rather musty. On the palate it gets thick and tannic and a drying sensation takes over. The tart cherry fruit is starting to dry out. Another '83 that borders on being a gamble. —

A classic mouthful of Barolo, high in extract, acidity and tannin, with loads of fruit, including ripe plum, rose petal and road tar flavors that keep on developing. A big style that needs cellaring. —

Not a typical Barolo, but a good drink. Firmly structured with acid and tannins, filled out with soft, modest fruit flavors. Still, it needs three years for the tannins to soften. —

There's some ripe fruit under the chocolate, cedar and tobacco flavors and a hint of road tar, but it's balanced toward wood and not for the faint of heart; old style Brunello that may or may not outlive its tannin. —

Rich and massive but elegant too. It's loaded with berry, cassis and mint flavors and a wallop of tannin and oak. But it's pretty and refined, and this is just Margaux's second label. Give this one some cellar time. —

Defines elegance and sophistication with distinct tea, earthy chocolate, cherry and cassis flavors that gently unfold onthe palate. It's impeccibly well balanced with soft, smooth yet firm tannins that give it structure and depth. Should age 20 or 30 years, maybe longer. Tasted twice; first bottle was "corked". — JS

Your Rating

Tasting Note
Smells attractive, but on the palate it's extremely woody, tannic and dry and doesn't give the peppery cherry flavor much of a chance. Perhaps with time the wood will soften a bit, but our guess is it will always show its wood. 240 cases made. —

A massive concentration of rich, intense plum, cherry, spice, smoke and cho colate flavors that are wrapped in thick, rich tannins and cedary oak. It g ains intensity and vibrancy on the palate, a powerful wine with a distinct personality that will stand 20 years of cellaring- and then some. A great Petrus. —

A wine with great promise. It's rough now but has appealing woody and smoky aromas with concentrated ripe fruit flavors. Tannins need time to soften. —

Correct in every way, a spicy, peppery, ripe, full-bodied, rough and ready wine with enough tannin to cut through a rare steak. Drink it now if you don't mind the tannin, but a couple of years in the cellar won't hurt it at all. — HS

Showing a bit more maturity than you'd expect from an '83. It's got a disti nctly peppry quaility on the nose, but also some oxidation. There's good depth on the palate, showing full-bodied flavors, but again a shade more mature than you'd expect. —

Tarry, tough and dryingly tannic, yet there is a suppleness of structure underneath that gives hope that the wine will develop some smoothness in five years. Flavors hint at tobacco and chocolate, with a faint raisiny core and a hint of cherry. —

Not for everyone, but absolutely full of flavor and beautifully structured, harmonious and complex. Very tempting to drink now, but should improve. Drink now through 2005. 6,938 cases made. —

Brilliantly concentrated from beginning to end; oozing with black cherry, currant, plum and anise aromas and flavors that are focused and elegant on the long finish. The tannins are sufficiently integrated to make it drinkable now with hearty food, but it's tough enough to need until 1996 to 2000 to settle down. 4,500 cases made. —

Despite a lot of herbal aromas, it's rich, almost chocolaty on the palate, with chewy texture and a core of plum flavor. Big, nicely polished, beautifully balanced. —

The cracked pepper and plum aromas are very pretty, but the palate is much leaner, and it finishes with plenty of tannin. Needs time to smooth out and grow into its flavors. Best after 1993. —

This started out fine in the glass but quickly faded. It is over the hill. Medium red with a large garnet rim, light cassis and slight varnish aromas, medium-bodied, with slightly weedy, sweet fruit flavors and a light finish. Rather odd. — JS

A mouthful of minty Cabernet, high in extract and tannin but filled with flavors of plum, cherries and spice. Finish is smooth and even, well focused on the fruit complexities. Drink 1990-94. Better than Glen Ellen's so-called 'Proprietor's Reserve.' —

Tasting Note
Kosher. Plenty of ripe, generous fruit up-front, with layers of spice, currant, plum and cedar in a tight, lean, compact style that's firmer than most Alexander Valley Cabernets. The tannic finish suggests further cellaring before approaching. Drink now through 1997. —

A bit raw and coarse but there's some attractive Cabernet flavor, with currant, plum and spicy nuances. Like most '83s this will need some time to come around, but it's developing some complexity and it has good length. Drink now. —

Tasting Note
Aromatic and elegant, developing complexity and depth, a bit tannic, but that should disappear next to a good roast. Spicy, leathery and toasty flavors blend nicely with the fruit. —
