Tasted from magnum. This vintage, for Lafite, deserves the reputation that '61 has. Only the '89 vintage tasted better out of 93 vintages in the tasting. Its hallmark is a minty juniper aroma backed by luscious, rich, elegant flavors of black cherry so ripe and intense that they're almost pruny. Complete and delicious.--Lafite Rothschild vertical.

Tasting Note
A monster with a huge concentration of fruit. Deep gold in color, with amazingly rich aromas of roasted almonds, honey, apricots and fruit. Full-bodied and super-sweet, this is as thick as molasses and even sweeter. Can age as long as you like. Drink now. —

Tasting Note
Not a heavyweight, but very elegant. Somewhat odd in the aromas, but overflows with mineral, honey, smoke and botrytis character on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and sweet, with a refreshing finish. Slightly awkward in balance. Drinkable now. —

Tasting Note
A very cedary, oaky, minty Cabernet, with big, firm tannins. At this age it's very tough, almost raw, but there seems to be enough fruit underneath to make it worth the gamble of aging until about 1998, when it should open up. Tasted three times. —

A wall of tannin blocks entry to this deep, dark wine, overshadowing the tart black cherry and berry flavors. Smells inviting, but tastes very harsh and closed. Would need many years for the tannins to subside, but it's a gamble to cellar because of the heavy-handed style. 165 cases made. —

Tasting Note
Dark in color, bold, deep and concentrated, with firm, hard-edged currant, plum and cedar flavors. Turns earthy and extremely tannic on the finish. Best to let this one rest until 1998, but even then it may be tannic. 400 cases made. —

Tasting Note
A full-bodied red that's generous in flavor, but wrapped up tight with tannins and acidity. Too young to enjoy now; will need cellaring for the tasty currant and cherry flavors to emerge from the youthful, tough texture. Best after 1995. 25,000 cases made. —

Tasting Note
Lean and coarse, with a tight, narrow band of oak, spice, celery and hints of tropical fruit flavors that turns very tart on the finish. An awkward wine that finishes with lots of flavors, but they're not all pleasant. Drinkable now. —

Rich and oaky; isn't everyone's glass of wine, but offers loads of cedar, tobacco box, plum and leather flavors in a tightly wrapped package that contains extremely firm tannins. From a producer who prides himself on aging his wines for about two and a half years in new oak barrels before bottling them unfiltered. Needs until 1998. —
