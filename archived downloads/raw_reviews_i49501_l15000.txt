Tasting Note
A smooth, rich and harmonious Cabernet from what is perhaps Heitz's best-known vineyard, this shows the signature minty-accented currant and black cherry flavors. It turns supple and silky on the way to a long, complex aftertaste, where it picks up cedar and chocolate notes. Drinkable now, but concentrated enough to cellar. 2,518 cases made. — JL

Tasting Note
A full-bodied '95, rather closed now. Rich and ripe, it coats the palate with its harmonious texture, showing hints of the lovely honey, citrus, hazelnut and smoke flavors that should explode around 2000 to 2005. Long, beautiful, subtle finish. —

Dense, dark, chewy and delicious, overflowing with ripe berry, vanilla, floral and herbal flavors that meander for a long finish. A serious wine with distinctive character, it needs cellaring until 2001 to 2003 to settle down. 2,691 cases made. —

It offers apricot and cherry flavors and the goût de terroir of flint, wet soil and matchstick notes. For all that, though, it's clean and pure, and the balance is flawless. A memorable drinking experience now, it will be best after 2000 and might benefit from decanting. — PM

Powerful and distinctive. An unusual Sancerre, from the deep gold color to the rich, toasty aromas to the full, even tannic, mouthfeel. Yet the well-defined herbal and spiced-pear flavors are beautifully typical of Loire Sauvignon Blanc. This is an unyielding wine, with none of the easy fruitiness of New World Chardonnay, but it rewards attention with complexity and style. Much better than previously reviewed.

Hard as nails, it gives little now, but there's lots of stuffing here, with a wet earth, citrus, stemmy, appleskin character softened by some honey notes. Full-bodied, long and rich, it should be a beauty around 2005. (Recent bottling may have shocked the wine, says winemaker Michel Caillot.) —

Tasting Note
A fine and flavorful Cabernet whose subtle flavors expand on the finish, building layers of complexity. It's deep in color, spicy in aroma, currantlike in flavor, firmly tannic but smooth--a class act all the way around. Drink now through 2004. —

Tasted two bottles, the second of which was better, but both offered a backward, angular, medium-bodied wine that's very closed and tough. Interesting mocha, spice, licorice, red- and blackberry aromas follow through on the palate, but you wish the finish was more supple and balanced, and not dominated by green, dry and astringent tannins that are surprisingly rustic for such a glamorous wine. Given its track record, perhaps it will smooth out with several year of cellaring, but unlike some top '94 grands crus, it lacks harmony at this stage. Perhaps better after 2005. 1,600 cases made. —

Tasting Note
A beauty. Elegant and refined, a delicate '94 that then kicks in with power on the finale. It's supple, intense and flavorful, with crisp, freshly crushed red berry, violet, rose petal and toasted spice notes; the tannins are firm, should soften with cellaring. Best after 2000. 700 cases made. —

Supple, ripe tannins. So sweet I had it analyzed for residual sugar, but none was found by the lab. Long finish that won't stop. Tempting now, better from 2000 to 2005. — PM

Tasting Note
Alluring and distinctive. The spicy, gamy aromas are very expressive of Syrah; the palate is rich and concentrated, with ripe black cherry flavor accented with mineral, licorice and game notes, then very tannic on the finish. A terrific example of the traditional style. Drink beginning in 1999. 1,083 cases made. — PM

The pungent gamy aroma says Syrah, but it's a bit one-dimensional on the palate, where light cherry and plum flavors are overmatched by earthy, gamy notes and tough tannins. It has concentration, though, and may come around; try in 1999. 2,600 cases made. — TM

From New Zealand comes this honey-scented Chardonnay, its ripe, spicy flavors spreading nicely across the tightly wound structure and finishing with real depth. It's an immensely appealing, polished wine that feels like it has room to grow through 1999 to 2000. Delicious. 3,000 cases made. — HS

Its core of ripe, rich currant and black cherry flavors unfolds into a supple, polished texture, and the flavors are pure, focused and linger long on the finish--a most encouraging sign. Best after 2000. 13,350 cases made. — JL

Tasting Note
Gorgeous Dolcetto from one of Piedmont's masters. Racy, with impressive concentration of vivid, sweet-tasting and ripe cassis and blackberry flavors, bursting with rose petal and violet aromas. Medium-bodied, the ripe, smooth tannins fold like silk on the palate, and the lively, well-defined flavors cascade to a deliciously balanced finish. We can only wish all Dolcettos were this beautiful. Drink now through 2000. — PM

Tasting Note
Big, ripe, rich and tannic, it's a blockbuster style that packs in lots of exotic mineral and wild berry flavors but offers little in the way of polish or finesse. Needs hearty fare. Best after 1999. 1,400 cases made. —

Tasting Note
Displaying ripe flavors of plums, prunes, plenty of chocolate-scented oak and a thick, jammy texture, this Chilean red is a bit clumsy now, but promises good drinking with another year in the bottle. Much better than samples reviewed earlier sent by an unauthorized importer. Drink now through 1998. 20,000 cases made. — TM

Lush and ripe, velvety in texture, with a lovely dried herb, wet earth, citrus and cream character. Full-bodied, superbly balanced. You want to just drink and drink this one, it's so fresh and complex. Delicious from start to finish. Good now, better after 2000. Bravo.--Chardonnay Challenge. — PM

A bit coarse, and although the apple, pear and lanolin flavors come through, their intensity and concentration fail to match the structure. A mint or basil note appears just before the hot finish. — BS

Tasting Note
Rich and ripe, but quite subtle and reserved on the nose now, with hints of citrus, pear and apple. Quite forward on the palate, with lots of fruit and lime flavors, but lacks the sort of flawless texture I expect from top '95 white Burgundy. Turns slightly tough on the oaky, smoky finish. Still, an outstanding wine. My guess is California. Better after 2000?--Chardonnay Challenge. 700 cases made. — PM
