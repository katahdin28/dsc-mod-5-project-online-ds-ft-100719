Tasting Note
A noble experiment that doesn't quite work. This late-harvest wine is full-bodied and sweet, rich with the spice of botrytis, but it also has an aggressive vegetal streak. Stump your friends. Drink now. —

Tasting Note
Surprisingly delicate for white Hermitage, marrying melon, citrus and vanilla flavors in a well-balanced, clean package. Though not exuberantly fruity, it matches with poultry and meaty fish. —
