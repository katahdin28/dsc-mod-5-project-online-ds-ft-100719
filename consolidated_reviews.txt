Tasting Note
A well-preserved '88 that looks and feels like a serious, full-bodied, tannic wine. But the fruit flavors are subdued and it hasn't yet developed the complexity of age. Worth cellaring if you're a gambler. Best from 1996 through 1998. 1,500 cases made. � KM

Tasting Note
This is a big and burly wine, but it's somewhat sharp and hard. Deeply colored, with heavy berry and cheese aromas. It's full-bodied, with sharp tannins and lots of fruit. Perhaps overdone and maybe just a little high in volatile acidity. Drink now.--Super Tuscan retrospective. � JS

Bottle age has given this wine rich, exotic mature flavors of tobacco, cedar, plums and prunes; it's big but silky, firm but well-integrated, with a core of tannins that support but never intrude. Though it lacks the grapey freshness characteristic of young Beaujolais, it has only grown over time. Drink now. �

Tasting Note
Unique, concentrated, and not to everyone's taste. It pours from the bottle like molasses or motor oil, has intense aromas of menthol, tar and brandy-soaked walnut shells, then rolls viscous and heavy across the palate, with conflicting signals of bitter and sweet, evoking memories of blackstrap desserts and castor-oil medicines. Drink it by the thimbleful. 54 cases made. �

Exotic and hedonistic. Coffee and cocoa aromas give way to nutty, honey, lemon and orange flavors, bold and fresh. It's noticeably sweet but full of fruit, and firm, even tannic. Only a fiery alcohol finish detracts from the balance. 20 cases made. �

Packed with flavor, but not heavy-handed, this features ripe apricot, pine and spice notes, with vibrant acidity and a clean, fresh finish. Exuberant and young, it should benefit from aging. �

An attempt to fashion a complex wine that falls a bit short. Chewy with distinctive mint, menthol and cedar flavors that blow past the fruit, finishing tannic. Try cellaring. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Best after 1998. �

This wine showed the best of the three Diamond Creek bottlings. Rich and earthy, but deeply colored and very concentrated, it has uncommon depth and intensity for a Cabernet this age. While exhibiting exceptionally well now, it appears to have the kind of richness and intensity to improve for another decade. Still, it's best to drink soon rather than risk its drying out.--1974 California Cabernet horizontal. 105 cases made. � JL

Tasting Note
Tight and firm, with an earthy mint and cedary edge to the herb and currant-laced Merlot flavors. Smells more complex than what it delivers, picking up cherry and currant before finishing with cedary herbal notes and firm but supple tannins. Pahlmeyer's second Merlot. Best to cellar short-term and see what happens. 400 cases made. � JL

A nicely balanced Pinot Noir with tart, mature flavors of cherry, anise and menthol and earthiness, but it lacks the depth and character to be great. Best to drink it up now while it still has its fruit. �
