Tasting Note
Smells spicy and fruity, with hints of leather and wood, but the rich, lush plum, cherry and raspberry flavors come pouring through on the palate. This Rhône-style blend delivers a lot of flavor, but it's not too tannic. Drink now through 1996. 440 cases made. —

Tasting Note
A weedy, herbal style that also serves up a core of currant and earth flavors, all of which add up to a nice wine with flavor. Firm tannins on the finish, but as 1989s go this one is probably about as good as it gets. 2,000 cases made. —

Tasting Note
So slick and clean. The best standard vintage Moet we have had in years. A solid wine. This wine perfectly marries the ripe fruit and toasty character. Full bodied and refined with a long silky texture. A perfect Champagne for drinking now but will age for years to come. —
