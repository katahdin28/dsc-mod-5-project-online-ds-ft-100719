Complex nose, with layers of dried fruit, allspice, minerals and hints of coffee cream, tobacco and leather. Full-bodied, with peppery fruit and mineral on the palate, big, young tannins and a long, long finish. Ultrarich. Re-mortgage for this one. Drink now through 2010. 600 cases made. — JS

Tasting Note
Chunky, with blackberry and black currant fruit offset by tar, roasted chestnut and pepper notes. Chewy finish, but good density of fruit. A powerful, muscular offering that wins on old-style guts, rather than polish. Best from 2006 through 2010. 120 cases made. — JM

Tasting Note
Shows a piercing note of humus to go with its mango, dried pineapple and fig flavors. Has a matchstick note as well on the minerally finish. Has more length than the '01 and '02, while the fruit has more of a dried quality in the end.--Baumard non-blind vertical. Drink now through 2012. 1,200 cases made. — JM

Gorgeous, clear amber color with powerful aromas of papaya, mango and quince paste that lead to a lush palate loaded with fruit, followed by green almond, green tea, orange blossom and mineral notes.

Stunning. With mature, burnished notes of candied citrus peel and ginger, clove, fig, quince paste, persimmon and green tea, this offers a rare level of complexity. Yet a current of live-wire acidity still runs underneath it all, cutting through to a mouthwatering finish that makes you beg for more. A case study in greatness.--Baumard non-blind vertical.

Not quite as broad and generous as riper vintages, but tremendously classy, offering smoky, earthy blackberry, plum and currant fruit that compete effectively against cedary oak on the long finish. The flavors gain with each sip, fanning out impressively. It's tight now, but it could age beautifully. Best after 2009. 8,000 cases made. —

Tasting Note
Rich flavors of blackberry and espresso run through this thick, muscular red. Though very ripe, it retains enough acidity for balance, once the chewy tannins let go of your palate. Big and bold, if not exactly elegant. Best after 2005. 6,700 cases made. — TM

Tasting Note
Tasting this evokes a cool, green, leafy glade, yet there's also candied spice-box, citrus and green tea shadings. It's assertive and vividly structured, with a tactile sensation on the finish. Not what I consider textbook flavors, given the new oak accents, but this is delicious. Drink now through 2012. — BS
